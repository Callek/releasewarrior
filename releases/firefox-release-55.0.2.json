                "nthomas: Updates - expecting that RelMan will ask for all 55.0 and 55.0.1 users to get 55.0.2 with no what's new page; that for 54.0.1 and older some percentage of background requests will get 55.0.2 with what's new page (otherwise 54.0.1), while all manual requests should get 55.0.2 with what's new ([Bug 1389560](https://bugzil.la/1389560)). Set up release-localtest and release-cdntest to do that (rule id's 628+56 627+585) except with 0% for background requests since that'll make testing reproducable. Added a scheduled change for release channel, guessing 20% background rate."
