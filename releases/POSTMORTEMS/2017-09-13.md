# Postmortem 2017-09-13

## Completed Releases
## Release: Firefox 56.0b10 2017-09-08

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- nthomas: Reran several windows repack jobs for exceptions getting a signing token. Partly spot instances disappearing, partly fallout from [Bug 1387194](https://bugzil.la/1387194). The latter is also causing delays as jobs try to get a token from servers other than signing-linux4 and hit a cert error, eventually they ask that one working server and continue. catlee landed a buildbotcustom change to how we verify certs.


## Release: Devedition 56.0b10 2017-09-08

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- nthomas: First graph submission failed with [this error](https://irccloud.mozilla.com/pastebin/IjnmZQsp/), which is as if releasetasks wasn't on [the tip](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/releasetasks/commit/aac1b21d5ab5f931c89172c22ce4d557cd0bf42c). That's strange because Firefox 56.0b10 started fine, straight after deved failed, and AFAIK releasetasks pulls are all manual. Starting the release again ran error free


## Release: Firefox 56.0b11 2017-09-12

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- nthomas: [Bug 1398964](https://bugzil.la/1398964) - rerun Publish to balrog jobs when they hit "Error calling link for balrogVPNProxy : Gateway Timeout"
- nthomas: Related to above, we had a second balrog publish failure but ran push to releases/uptake monitoring/final verification. While pushing doesn't require balrog the final verification does, so it failed and retried 3 times, then hit an hg error which didn't retry
