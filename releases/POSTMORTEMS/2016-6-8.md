# Postmortem 2016-6-8

## Release: Firefox 45.2.0esr 16-06-02

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- Old release process started in parallel with release promotion, because bm81's release-runner was out of date and grabbed the release at the same time with relpro. Updated the checkout, restarted release-runner. Stopped running builds
- The old process bumped the version on default, what caused some l10n repacks to rerun. Filed bug 1277443 to address the issue.
- aW9wfgRNRXSDOxvko0x6aQ firefox mozilla-esr45 win32 l10n repack 6/10 timed out. Manually reran using tctalker
- all win32 l10n beetmover tasks failed because we don't generate stub installer, see bug 1276451. Requires build 2 :(

## Release: Firefox 47.0 16-06-01

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- yAN46JZnTJeeq7NEvOBVXg firefox mozilla-release updates run 0 failed, because the push to hg.m.o raced with http://hg.mozilla.org/build/tools/rev/154c6052d713. See http://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/tinderbox-builds/mozilla-release-noarch/release-mozilla-release-firefox_updates-bm74-build1-build1.txt.gz for the details. Automatic rerun fixed the issue.
- JK2xBU-0T5u1oJAQ7aCOUA linux64 beta update verification 9/12 failed, beacuse one of the headers returned by CDN was `X-Amz-Cf-Id: KhRL4H9Z6nms0MVAC-Po0nT0cQd9G3doIMAZWMeFAILGRrONF1LhBA==` which matches the `FAIL` pattern. Automatic rerun passed
