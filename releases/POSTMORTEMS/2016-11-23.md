## Release: Firefox 51.0b2 2016-11-21

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- 'firefox mozilla-beta checksums builder', exception. possibly completed too quick for bbb, solution: tctalker rerun+report_completed to resolve since bbot reported that it did run green
- [Bug 1271614](https://bugzil.la/1271614): 'ka' and 'kab' locales are failing to provide partial updates. see beta-cdntest release-drivers email for details. I recommended that we ignore those failures as these are new locales that do not have completes in all versions within partial list. I've left the failing update-verify and final verify jobs as failed. Maybe they should stay red for history sake and skip right to completing the publish human decision task when requested
