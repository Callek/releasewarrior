- Three partner repacks 'running' for a long time - macosx64 EME-free repacks, macosx64 partner repacks, win64 EME-free repacks. Actually green in buildbot but not reflected back to TC. jonasf1 commented on irc 'looked a queue timeouts, looks like a pulse disconnect, crash and restart'. Cancel and rerun so we get logs to go with our bits

## Release: Fennec 51.0.4 2017-02-14

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- Partner-driven - not planning to push to Google Play
- Repack 9/10 hit an issue with mock and s3, rerun.
- Cleared 'is shipped' flag in ship-it because Fennec 51.0.4 appeared on https://product-details.mozilla.org/1.0/mobile_versions.json. Sylvestre reported this caused some confusion as we only published it on the release directory only (and not on Google Play).
