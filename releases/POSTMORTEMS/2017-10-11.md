## Buildnum 2
### Issues
- callek: An unrelated build/tools patch caused the release to fail (which landed on Oct 3), reran the jobs after the fix.
- callek: Repacks however used that broken tagged version of build/tools so aborted build in favor of a build 3

## Release: Firefox 56.0.1 2017-10-03

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- SPECIAL REQUIREMENT:  Use the transform_balrog_blob.py script in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1393789 change the complete mar urls to point to bz2 mars.  Once the new release blob has been submitted to balrog we need resolve the start_update_verify_human_decision task that rail added in releasetasks
- SPECIAL REQUIREMENT: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1391718 Add LZMA/SHA384 watershed when 56.0 ships
- SPECIAL REQUIREMENT: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1405012 Implement a watershed for win32-win64 migration before 56.0.1 ships
- kmoir: see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c9hWwCdN4w2MHN2lTxFZ0nIs8neH6R7VLKogIdZqhJA/edit#heading=h.5eopgyoyeruv for details on 56.0.1 win32->win64 rules
- nthomas: Funsize submitter bustage from [Bug 1402015](https://bugzil.la/1402015), rail [landed a fix](https://hg.mozilla.org/build/tools/rev/912affa82eef). We'll do a build2 to pick it up

- kmoir: see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c9hWwCdN4w2MHN2lTxFZ0nIs8neH6R7VLKogIdZqhJA/edit#heading=h.5eopgyoyeruv for details on 56.0.1 win32->win64 rules
- jlorenzo: Uncharted territory: We have to manually generate win32->64 partials. [Bug 1405681](https://bugzil.la/1405681) - Create partial updates to migrate eligible 56.0 win32 users to 56.0.1 win64
- jlund: final verify failed but expected. all failures were coming from 56.0. Only 56.0 updates that should work are win32 requests that set flags that allow for migration. we have to rely on QE
- callek: Generation code for the stripped balrog release blob is in [bugzilla](https://[Bug 1393447](https://bugzil.la/1393447).bmoattachments.org/attachment.cgi\?id=8902074)
- jlorenzo: Publish tasks expired. I cloned and tweaked them to publish the release. Per the original requirements, new downloads on every platform will get a 56.0.1.
- jlorenzo: I changed the [release-cdntest rule](https://aus4-admin.mozilla.org/rules/659) to apply to every channel. Hence, I removed the original release-localtest rule and updates on release-cdntest are now served at 1%


## Release: Fennec 57.0b5 2017-10-03

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- none. flawless victory


## Release: Firefox 52.4.1esr 2017-10-05

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- callek: NOTE: 52.4.1esr is expected to ship updates to OSX only.
- nthomas: fallout from [Bug 1387622](https://bugzil.la/1387622). When we ship we'll need to manually adjust the [firefox-sha1 alias in bouncer](https://bounceradmin.mozilla.com/admin/mirror/productalias/12/) to point at 'Firefox-52.4.1esr-sha1'. This will be fixed in future releases. mbrandt may pop up on IRC if there is a delay in updating the alias, as he has a test suite that monitors it
- callek: [Bug 1406939](https://bugzil.la/1406939) - We hit Final Verify failures due to only shipping 52.4.1esr to OSX. I backed out the automation changes to update verify configs to allow us to test what we're expecting. And re-ran the final verify task
- callek: Unable to test rules which filter on OS_VERSION because we pass 'default'. Resorted to letting SV test the update rather than manually setting BUILD_TARGET to keep testing consistent between us and users
- jlorenzo: It wasn't a problem for this macos-only release, but this bug bit us again: [Bug 1407174](https://bugzil.la/1407174) - Cannot submit scheduled change to alias "esr52": Invalid input for rule_id. Not an integer. rule_id: u'esr52' is not a 'rule_id'
- jlorenzo: We need to mark this ESR as shipped. I don't have the rights to do so. [Bug 1388323](https://bugzil.la/1388323) - Cannot mark 52esr as shipped: HTTPError: 401 Client Error: Authorization Required for url: https://ship-it.mozilla.org/csrf_token

- SPECIAL REQUIREMENT: Talk to RelMan to see if it's the right time to [Bug 1397684](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1397684) - [push-apk] 57 cycle: Turn off staged rollout on beta
- callek: Docs for fennec beta publish were wrongly pointing at BB docs on the wiki, found [old docs](https://github.com/mozilla/releasewarrior/commit/2550cf4cf33d86dd06c662025db3e79ed0378791#diff-763a878f526b6026bd5f5a3c37546f8bR317) with aki's help.
