Partly spot instances disappearing, partly fallout from [Bug 1387194](https://bugzil.la/1387194). The latter is also causing delays as jobs try to get a token from servers other than signing-linux4 and hit a cert error, eventually they ask that one working server and continue. catlee landed a buildbotcustom change to how we verify certs."
