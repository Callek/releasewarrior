- Lots of Balrog submission errors, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1295450

## Release: Fennec 49.0b2 2016-08-08

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- SETA Broke ([Bug 1293538](https://bugzil.la/1293538) and [Bug 1293544](https://bugzil.la/1293544)) -- I also didn't realize fennec b2 was submitted at all, so noticed the brokenness in the build not having started late at night. SETA finally fixed late-day on tuesday (Aug 9).
- Since the releaserunner bustage happened during reconfig had to backout the hg config changes to keep the config bump from actually being able to commit/push without breaking
