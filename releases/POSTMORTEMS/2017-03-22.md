## Release: Firefox 52.0.1esr 2017-03-16

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- en-US beetmover failed because of a missing uplift of [Bug 1343524](https://bugzil.la/1343524). Build aborted

## Buildnum 2
### Issues
- After the uplift of [Bug 1343524](https://bugzil.la/1343524), release-runner was in an odd shape. It declared no "signed_task_id" which seems like a file in release runner was not updated. After some investigation, it might have been a .pyc that needed to be refreshed.
- update verify died trying to test 45.8.0 updates
- ftr: manually bumped next version on FIREFOX_ESR_52_0_X_RELBRANCH via https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr52/rev/b7074346b82ed2819c448ebc66bdc3f497507897
- esr-localtest needed the ESR52 rule adjusted so that it had higher priority than ESR45, and matched on version >= 52.0 instead of > 52.0. esr-cdntest and esr channels were OK
- NEEDS ACTION: [Bug 1348428](https://bugzil.la/1348428) - shipit not reporting 52.0.1esr as FIREFOX_ESR_NEXT
- jlorenzo killed running/pending funsize to speed up 52.0.1 release; aki reran cancelled once release was ready

- Large lag in funsize signing workers -- Aki noticed that signingworker1 was running an m-c nightly when he checked. We need to up the size of the pool, pause/stagger other tasks, or deal w/ priority levels
- watch pending doesn't spin up instances for release tasks -- publish release was stuck waiting for instances
