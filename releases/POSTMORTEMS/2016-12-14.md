## Release: Firefox 51.0b7 2016-12-12

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- BBB reported the checksum builder as exception. Reran/resolved to workaround, but because the builder is not idempotent it regenerated the GPG signature. As a result the partner repacks push to cdns builder failed, because it refused to overwrite the signature. Forced the uptake monitoring builder to work around.
