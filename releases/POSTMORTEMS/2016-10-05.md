- Release-runner error due to buildbot vs TC build on linux64 [bug 1304260](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1304260). Reran linux64 on buildbot to update index, then started in ship-it
- Source generation task failed because it's using the old gecko hierarchy [bug 1304333](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1304333). Rail pulled a more recent desktop-build image and patched it under his docker account and used that as a temp solution

## Release: Firefox 50.0b4 2016-10-04

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- Problem starting the release as only the TC build was done, and it confused release-runner. [Bug 1307326](https://bugzil.la/1307326). Worked around by waiting for buildbot and restarting in ship-it
- uptake monitoring burns out before sha1 repacks are all done. Known [Bug 1300060](https://bugzil.la/1300060). Rerun successfully with tctalker.
- win64 l10n repack 1/10 had a hg clone hiccup which eventuall ran successfully. Mozharness parsed the log as failed and reported as failed task. Following jobs retriggered by TC queue reported as failed because run 0 was claimed by another worker. They were harmless since first run actually completed successfully and attached artifacts to the corresponding job.
