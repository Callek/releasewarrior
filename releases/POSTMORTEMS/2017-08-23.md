# Postmortem 2017-08-23

## Completed Releases
## Release: Firefox 56.0b3 2017-08-15

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- nthomas: Update verify errors with buildID mistmatches from special rule for manual updates. Made rule id 626 point to Firefox-56.0b3-build1 instead of 56.0b2. Reran jobs that ran out of retries.
- nthomas: [Bug 1390071](https://bugzil.la/1390071) - snap job failed, non-blocking
- nthomas: Updates - for users still on 55.0 or older Relman wants to serve 56.0b3 to 50% of background requests and 100% of manual requests. That is set up on beta-cdntest. There is a scheduled change (change id 231) set up for this which will need signoff at the same time as the main beta rule
- kmoir: had to go modify rule 32 so that it pointed to 56.0b3


## Release: Devedition 56.0b3 2017-08-15

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- nthomas: schedule signoff job failed because release_eta was 'in the past'. Manually scheduled a rule change (id 237)
- nthomas: [Bug 1391102](https://bugzil.la/1391102) - didn't get AWS instances to do post release builders. Hacked build-cloud-tools/cloudtools/buildbot.py on aws-manager2 so yesterday was 3 days ago


## Release: Thunderbird 52.3.0 2017-08-15

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- kmoir: repacks failed on 2/10 and 10/10 linux64, 7/10 linux - reran the jobs
- kmoir: [Bug 1356562](https://bugzil.la/1356562) - [Thunderbird] update_verify: Linux updates fail because libgtk-3 is missing
- nthomas: Skipped the update_shipping_release builder because changes had already been made manually and [Bug 1388330](https://bugzil.la/1388330) would have meant it failed anyway
- nthomas: [Bug 1392138](https://bugzil.la/1392138) - checksums file not accurate, from rerunning repacks when they'd already auto-retriggered ?


## Release: Firefox 55.0.2 2017-08-16

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- nthomas: Got 503 errors from task scheduler API but the graph was still submitted and is running. Cleaned up ship-it db state and emailled r-d
- nthomas: Updated Balrog rule id 627 mapping from Firefox-55.0.1-build2-whatsnew to Firefox-55.0.2-build1. Will need to set it to Firefox-55.0.2-build1-whatsnew once that exists
- nthomas: Updates - expecting that RelMan will ask for all 55.0 and 55.0.1 users to get 55.0.2 with no what's new page; that for 54.0.1 and older some percentage of background requests will get 55.0.2 with what's new page (otherwise 54.0.1), while all manual requests should get 55.0.2 with what's new ([Bug 1389560](https://bugzil.la/1389560)). Set up release-localtest and release-cdntest to do that (rule id's 628+56 627+585) with 20% guess for background requests; that'll make QE testing hard. Added a scheduled change for release channel (change id 232).
- nthomas: Updates - [Bug 1389312](https://bugzil.la/1389312) will result in no scheduled change for the main release rule (id 145). We'll manually have to add one pointing to Firefox-55.0.2-build1, and email r-d when the change is signed off and actioned.
