## Completed Releases
## Release: Firefox 56.0b12 2017-09-14

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- jlorenzo: One balrog submission task failed: Timeout to connect to balrogVpnProxy. Reran task. It passed
- jlorenzo: A dozen balrog submission tasks failed because Balrog returned 400: 'Failed to update row, old_data_version doesn't match current data_version'. Reran all tasks and they passed.
- jlorenzo: Because of issues above, cdntest email went out before Balrog got all mar info uploaded.
- jlorenzo: Failed to schedule publishing in balrog, because ETA was set in the past. I created a cloned task via task-creator with an updated ETA
- jlorenzo: As a consequence of the ETA being updated, I recreated the email r-d task to pick the right dependency and to reflect to new ETA
- jlorenzo: Cancelled version bump because 57.0 was already on mozilla-beta
- jlorenzo: Manually pushed the tags FIREFOX_56_0b12_BUILD1 FIREFOX_56_0b12_RELEASE, because they were part of the version bump

## Release: Devedition 57.0b1 2017-09-15

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- SPECIAL REQUIREMENT: Verify that the patches identified for desktop in [Bug 1397721](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1397721#c17) has landed and reconfigured. DONE!
- POTENTIAL ISSUE: Cross-Channel L10n new in this release, should use l10n-central repo. See [Bug 1397721](https://bugzil.la/1397721)
- SPECIAL REQUIREMENT: cancel bouncer aliases job after graph submission, to prevent 57.0b1 appearing as a download at end of release process. DONE!
- nthomas: [Bug 1400119](https://bugzil.la/1400119) - source builder failed
- nthomas: [Bug 1400141](https://bugzil.la/1400141) - balrog submission errors, reran failing tasks
- jlorenzo: Because source builder failed, the rest of the graph was stuck. I didn't manage to force the source-related tasks to complete, because Taskcluster is too smart. To complete a task, you need it to be in pending. Otherwise, taskcluster doesn't accept a failed/exception task to change to complete. Also, running tasks are already claimed, and Taskcluster doesn't allow you to override the status. Workers were too fast to claim tasks. I haven't managed to get the right time window to mark tasks as completed. As a consequnce, build 2 was started with source turned off (hotfix).

## Incomplete Releases
## Release: Thunderbird 56.0b4 2017-09-05

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- nthomas: Win32 build failed, needs some [uplifts](https://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central/pushloghtml?changeset=bb864aeadf15)


## Release: Firefox 52.4.0esr 2017-09-18

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- kmoir: One balrog submission task failed: Timeout to connect to balrogVpnProxy. Reran task. It passed


## Release: Firefox 56.0 2017-09-19

## Buildnum 1
### Issues
- SPECIAL REQUIREMENT: [Bug 1397950](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1397950) - update tc_indexes for mozilla-release. DONE
- SPECIAL REQUIREMENT: [Bug 1388460](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1388460) https://dxr.mozilla.org/build-central/source/tools/lib/python/kickoff/__init__.py#176. DONE
- SPECIAL REQUIREMENT: [Bug 1395697](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1395697) Generate lzma and bz2 compressed mar files as a part of release automation. We should start generating them as a part of 56.0 RC1 build and the file name pattern is *.bz2.complete.mar.  There is no automation around balrog submission and update verification yet. We will need to modify the release blobs and the rules to make update verification work.  We still need to update the docs (probably while we build 56) to reflect these changes.
- nthomas: Bouncer submission failed due to a typo in patch from [Bug 1395697](https://bugzil.la/1395697). rail fixed and landed, then cloned the failing task and updated to the new rev ([new task](https://tools.taskcluster.net/groups/Co8iBgS1RnKVNOWMZm0TUg/tasks/Co8iBgS1RnKVNOWMZm0TUg/details), no dependencies to worry about). Will have problems with uptake monitoring and boucner aliases. Expected workarounds - uptake: clone to run task, rerun original task and mark completed quickly enough that the bbb doesn't pick it up; aliases: clone. Goes away if we do a build2
- catlee: [Bug 1400141](https://bugzil.la/1400141) - balrog submission errors, reran failing tasks
- jlorenzo: [Bug 1395697](https://bugzil.la/1395697): Partial updates remained LZMA-compressed (instead of BZ2). Per catlee's suggestion, I removed the partial entries in the BZ2 release blob and reran the Update Verify jobs
- jlorenzo: [Bug 1395697](https://bugzil.la/1395697) - Update Verify jobs were still expecting partial updates. I changed the update configuration
- jlorenzo: [Bug 1395697](https://bugzil.la/1395697): I inadvertently removed some macOS locales from the blob. I reintroduced them and reran all Update Verify jobs
- jlorenzo: [Bug 1395697](https://bugzil.la/1395697): ta/linux64's mar got the wrong size and hash. I manually changed them as they were manually uploaded
- jlorenzo: Discovered [Bug 1401176](https://bugzil.la/1401176) - extract_and_run_command.py: ImportError: No module named mar
