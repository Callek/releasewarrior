- nthomas: 'Failed to start release promotion (graph ID: FFXri8qpQ-WEscEoLlMTcA). Error(s): You didn\'t give the task-graph scopes allowing it define tasks on the queue.' in ship-it. Graph does exist in TC but all tasks are unscheduled. releaserunner log has 'You only have the scopes: ['docker-worker:*']'. Transient ?? Doing a build2 for deved l10n bustage anyway
