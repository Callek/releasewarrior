To complete a task, you need it to be in pending. Otherwise, taskcluster doesn't accept a failed/exception task to change to complete. Also, running tasks are already claimed, and Taskcluster doesn't allow you to override the status. Workers were too fast to claim tasks. I haven't managed to get the right time window to mark tasks as completed. As a consequnce, build 2 was started with source turned off (hotfix)."
