## Create release blob for 56.0rc  (draft)


### Release automation creates a human decision task to block the updates after they are generated.
### Use the transform_balrog_blob.py script in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1393789 change the complete mar urls to point to bz2 mars.  This script:
#### downloads the complete mars
#### arguments are the blob name, output should be redirected to a file
#### complete mars are converted to bz2, file sizes and file hashes are updated
### You also need to create a what''s new page for bz2
### Test watershed on release localtest
### Verify that release automation strips out partials (Should do this)
### Verify the mars are recompressed and signed?
### Once the new release blob has been submitted to balrog we need resolve the start_update_verify_human_decision task that rail added in releasetasks
