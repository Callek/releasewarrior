## Create release blob for 56.0rc  (draft)


### Release automation creates a human decision task to block the updates after they are generated.
    (Do we still need to run  repack_mars.py, rail''s patch seems just run one format or the other depending on version  https://github.com/mozilla-releng/releasetasks/commit/6a999916fdb1da8f6b4d7e5ef2b7a85aac1c1ecb
### Loan yourself an aws instance to download run the script that will transform the release blob.  This script will download all the complete mars, so if you run the script on your laptop it will be too slow.
### Use the transform_balrog_blob.py script in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1393789 change the complete mar urls to point to bz2 mars.  This script:
#### downloads the complete mars
#### arguments are the blob name, output should be redirected to a file
#### complete mars are converted to bz2, file sizes and file hashes are updated
### You also need to create a what''s new page for bz2
### Test watershed on release localtest
### Verify that release automation strips out partials (Should do this)
### Verify the mars are recompressed and signed?
### Once the new release blob has been submitted to balrog we need resolve the start_update_verify_human_decision task that rail added in releasetasks
