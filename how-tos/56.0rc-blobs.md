## Create release blob for 56.0rc  (draft)


* Release automation creates a human decision task to block the updates after they are generated.
* You'll need to import the release's ggp key into your keyring, for example wget http://releases.mozilla.com/pub/firefox/candidates/56.0-candidates/build1/KEY; and gpg --import KEY
* Use the transform_balrog_blob.py script in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1393789 change the complete mar urls to point to bz2 mars. 
* Arguments are the release name and output file.  Example: python2.7 transform_balrog_blob.py Firefox-56.0-build1 blob.json
* References to complete mars are converted to bz2, file sizes and file hashes are updated
* You also need to create a what''s new page for bz2
* Test watershed on release-localtest
* Verify that release automation strips out partials (Should do this according to rail)
* Update release blob for WNP, strip out 56.0b12 
* Once the new release blob has been submitted to balrog we need resolve the start_update_verify_human_decision task that rail added in releasetasks
